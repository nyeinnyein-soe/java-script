Array and Function Exercises
This repository contains my personal exercises and solutions for mastering arrays and functions. The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of these fundamental programming concepts and to practice using Git and GitHub for version control.

Project Overview
The exercises are organized by topic, with a focus on practical applications of arrays and functions. Each exercise is designed to challenge my skills in a specific area, such as:

Array Manipulation: Sorting, filtering, mapping, and reducing arrays.

Function Composition: Creating reusable and modular code.

Data Structures: Using arrays to implement basic data structures like stacks and queues.

Algorithm Practice: Solving common algorithmic problems with arrays and functions.

How to Navigate This Repository
The code is structured to be easy to follow. Each exercise is located in its own directory, with a clear and descriptive name.

Explore the Code: Navigate to the exercises/ directory to view the different problems.

Review Solutions: Within each exercise directory, you will find my solution, often accompanied by comments explaining the logic.

Contribute (Optional): Feel free to open a pull request if you have a more efficient or alternative solution. Constructive feedback is welcome!
